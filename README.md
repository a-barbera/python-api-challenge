Homework for Module 6 for Anna Barbera, APIs: WeatherPy and VacationPy

Dear User,

Please keep in mind that for WeatherPy, you will need to provide your own API key through OpenWeatherAPI and another key for Google API for VacationPy.  These should be placed in a config.py file labeled something to the effect of:

api_keys.py

with text inside formatted as such:

#OpenWeatherMap API Key

weather_api_key = ' YOUR KEY HERE '

#Google API Key

g_key = ' YOUR KEY HERE '

These will be necessary for you to run both of these notebooks effectively.
Thank you.
